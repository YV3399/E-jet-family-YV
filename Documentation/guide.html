<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Embraer E-Jet family is a series of narrow-body short- to medium-range
twin-engine jet airliners, carrying 66 to 124 passengers commercially,
manufactured by Brazilian aerospace manufacturer Embraer. The aircraft family
was first introduced at the Paris Air Show in 1999 and entered production in
2002. The series has been a commercial success primarily due to its ability to
efficiently serve lower-demand routes while offering many of the same amenities
and features of larger jets. The aircraft is used by mainline and regional
airlines around the world but has proven particularly popular with regional
airlines in the United States. (Source:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embraer_E-Jet_family#E-190_and_195">wikipedia</a>).</p>

<p>This package for FlightGear includes the following types:</p>

<h3>E170</h3>

<p><img src="images/E170.jpg" alt="E170" title="" /></p>

<p>The original E-Jet, first to enter production. Seats 66-78 passengers, powered
by two GE CF34-8E engines.</p>

<h3>E175</h3>

<p><img src="images/E175.jpg" alt="E175" title="" /></p>

<p>A slight stretch of the E170, using the same wing, engines, flight deck and
systems. Seats 76-88 passengers.</p>

<h3>E190</h3>

<p><img src="images/E190.jpg" alt="E190" title="" /></p>

<p>A further stretch of the E175, with a larger wing, more powerful GE CF34-10E
engines, improved avionics, increased range, and faster cruise speed. Seats
96-114 passengers.</p>

<h3>E195</h3>

<p><img src="images/E195.jpg" alt="E195" title="" /></p>

<p>A slightly stretched, but otherwise identical, variant of the E190. Seats
100-124 passengers.</p>

<h3>Lineage 1000</h3>

<p><img src="images/Lineage1000.jpg" alt="Lineage1000" title="" /></p>

<p>A luxury bizjet conversion of the E190. The lower deck is filled entirely with
an additional fuel tank, increasing the aircraft's range to a whopping 4600
nmi; the upper deck can be configured to the customer's needs, and may include
a double-sized galley, master suite with a king-size double bed and bathroom,
large flatscreen, etc. A cargo compartment is also situated on the upper deck.
Typical configurations seat 12-19 passengers and their luggage.</p>

<h2>Preflight</h2>

<p>Before taking off, the wheel chocks and safety cones should be removed. This
can be done via the "E-jet-family" / "Airport Operations" menu. Also make sure
the doors are all closed, and the fuel truck is disconnected. The status of all
doors can be monitored on the Systems page on the MFD.</p>

<h2>Flight Deck Overview</h2>

<p><img src="images/flightdeck-overview.jpg" alt="Flight Deck" title="" /></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>PFD1/2</strong>: primary flight display, shows key information about the state of
the aircraft, including airspeed, vertical speed, attitude, autopilot, and
primary navigation.</li>
<li><strong>MFD1/2</strong>: multi-function display, shows navigation information and system
status.</li>
<li><strong>EFIS (EICAS)</strong>: displays information about the status of the engines,
flight controls, etc., and any warnings/errors that may exist.</li>
<li><strong>Glareshield Panel</strong> (GSP), used to control the autopilot and autothrottle.</li>
<li><strong>MCDU1/2</strong>, the primary interface to the flight management system (FMS),
also used to tune the aircraft's radios (NAV1/2, COM1/2, XPDR, TCAS, ADF1/2)</li>
<li><strong>Engine Controls</strong>, used to start and stop the engines. The startup process
is highly automated, so usually, it is enough to put the knobs in the right
position and watch the aircraft start itself.</li>
<li><strong>Speedbrake</strong> and <strong>Throttle Levers</strong> function as usual.</li>
<li><strong>Flap Lever</strong> controls flaps and leading-edge slats. There are 6 settings;
flaps 1 through 4 are used for takeoff and approach, flaps 5 and 6 (FULL) for
landing. Selecting flaps 5 or 6 automatically arms the ground spoilers. Note
that use of flaps 6 is not authorized for CAT-II landings.</li>
<li><strong>Parking Brake</strong> functions as usual.</li>
</ul>

<h2>MFD's and CCD's</h2>

<p>The real E-Jet uses a device known as the CCD (Cursor Control Device) to
provide a point-and-click style GUI on the EFIS screens, particularly the MFD.
The CCD consists of a trackpad, an "enter" button, three screen selector
buttons, and a two-ring twist knob for data entry. The pilot can use the screen
selector to move a cursor between PFD, MFD and EICAS screens; the touchpad
moves the cursor within the selected screen; the "enter" button selects
on-screen GUI elements; and the twist knob serves as a dynamic dial for various
inputs, such as map range etc.</p>

<p>Because we cannot provide a physical CCD in flightgear, the FlightGear E-Jet
emulates this functionality by allowing you to click directly onto the MFD, and
using the mouse scroll wheel to emulate the twist knob. Specifically, the
mapping works as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mouse click: position CCD cursor on clicked screen (currently only MFD is
supported), at the position of the click, and then click the CCD "enter"
button</li>
<li>Scroll wheel: twist outer ring of CCD data entry knob.</li>
<li>Shift + scroll wheel: twist inner ring of CCD data entry knob.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Startup Procedure</h2>

<p>The E-Jet has a largely automatic engine start procedure, driven by the FADEC
(Fully Autonomous Digital Engine Control).</p>

<p>On the ground, there are several ways of starting the engines; the engine
start itself is the same, what differs is how we set up the aircraft to feed
electricity, bleed air, and fuel to the engines so that they can start.</p>

<h3>Engine Start - Ground Power Unit (GPU) Connected</h3>

current heading.</li>
<li>5: <strong>Speed knob</strong>. Rotate: select target speed. Push: switch KIAS / Mach.
Rotate ring: switch manual selection / FMS managed speed.</li>
<li>6: <strong>Altitude knob</strong>. Rotate: select target altitude in 100ft increments.
Shift-rotate: select target altitude in 1000ft increments. Push: toggle ft/m
(NOT IMPLEMENTED YET).</li>
<li>7: <strong>FPA knob</strong>. Select flight path angle when in FPA mode.</li>
<li>8: <strong>V/S wheel</strong>. Select vertical speed when in VS mode.</li>
<li>13: <strong>NAV button</strong>. Select NAV lateral mode. When navigation source is FMS1
or FMS2, engage LNAV mode (track flight plan); when navigation source is NAV1
or NAV2, engage VOR mode (track VOR radial).</li>
<li>14: <strong>APP button</strong>. Arms lateral and vertical approach mode: lateral mode LOC
(localizer) is armed, and becomes active when the localizer is captured;
vertical mode GS (glideslope) is armed, and becomes active when the
glideslope is intercepted. Before intercept, the currently selected lateral
and vertical modes remain active.</li>
<li>15: <strong>HDG button</strong>. Selects the lateral HDG mode; if HDG mode is already
active, selects "wings level" mode instead.</li>
<li>16: <strong>AP button</strong>. Engages / disconnects the autopilot.</li>
<li>17: <strong>YD button</strong>. Turns the Yaw Damper on or off. In normal flight, the yaw
damper should always be on.</li>
<li>18: <strong>SRC button</strong>. Switches navigation source between the captain's side
(NAV1 / FMS1) and the first officer's side (NAV2 / FMS2).</li>
<li>19: <strong>A/T button</strong>. Engages / disengages autothrottle.</li>
<li>20 <strong>VNAV button</strong>. Turns VNAV (vertical navigation) on or off. In VNAV mode,
the FMS automatically selects vertical modes for the autopilot to match the
vertical profile calculated from the current flightplan. The aircraft will
not, however, climb or descend through the selected altitude.</li>
<li>21 <strong>FLCH button</strong>. Selects FLCH (Flight Level Change) vertical mode. If the
selected target altitude is higher than the current altitude, FLCH will
command climb thrust, and speed-with-pitch, in order to achieve the optimal
climb rate to the target altitude. If the selected target altitude is lower
than the current altitude, FLCH will command idle thrust, and
speed-with-pitch, in order to achieve an optimal descent path. In both cases,
the selected airspeed will be maintained. If A/T is off, the pilot is
responsible for setting appropriate thrust for the climb or descent.</li>
<li>22 <strong>ALT button</strong>. Selects ALT hold mode. This will also set the target
altitude to the nearest multiple of 100 ft of the current altitude. Note that
you do not normally need this button, because in all climb and descent modes,
the aircraft automatically levels off at the target altitude, and switches to
ALT mode by itself.</li>
<li>23 <strong>FPA button</strong>. Selects FPA mode (flight path angle). When this button is
pushed, the aircraft will hold the current flight path angle until
intercepting the target altitude; by turning the FPA knob (7), the flight path
angle can be adjusted.</li>
<li>24 <strong>VS button</strong>. Selects VS mode (vertical speed). When this button is
pushed, the aircraft will hold the current vertical speed until
intercepting the target altitude; by turning the VS wheel (8), the flight path
angle can be adjusted.</li>
</ul>

<h3>PFD Autopilot Mode Annunciations</h3>

<p><img src="images/pfd-autopilot.jpg" alt="Autopilot Annunciations" title="" /></p>

<ul>
<li>1 <strong>Speed target</strong>. Displays the current speed target in KIAS or Mach. In
FMS Managed Speed mode, this display will be magenta; in Manual Speed mode,
it will be blue.</li>
<li>2 <strong>Autothrottle Mode</strong>. Upper = active, lower = armed. SPDt means speed
with throttle, SPDe means speed with elevator. TO, GA and HOLD are special
modes for takeoff and go-around.</li>
<li>3 <strong>AP and AT engagement</strong>. Upper = AP engaged, lower = AT engaged.</li>
<li>4 <strong>Nav source</strong>. Left = captain side, right = FO side. (NOT IMPLEMENTED
YET).</li>
<li>5 <strong>Lateral mode</strong>. Upper = active, lower = armed. TRACK = track runway
heading (takeoff / go-around), ROLL = roll hold,
HDG = track selected heading, VOR = track VOR
heading, LOC = track ILS localizer, LNAV = track FMS route. (Note that ROLL
will command 0° bank if bank angle is less than 6° upon activation).</li>
<li>6 <strong>Vertical mode</strong>. Upper = active, lower = armed. TO = takeoff, GA =
go-around, FLCH = flight level change, FPA = flight path angle, VS = vertical
speed, GS = ILS glideslope. If VNAV is active, modes are selected by the FMS,
and labelled VTO, VGA, VFLCH, VFPA. (VNAV never selects VS, so VVS does not
exist; VNAV should be disabled before arming APPR, so VGS is not a thing
either).</li>
<li>7 <strong>Altitude target</strong>. In VNAV mode: the altitude to which you are cleared to
climb or descend. VNAV will follow the calculated profile, but never climb
or descend past this altitude. In non-VNAV mode: the altitude at which to
level off.</li>
<li>8 <strong>FPA / VS target</strong>. The currently selected vertical speed or flight path
angle. In VNAV mode, the FMS will set this.</li>
<li>9 <strong>Autoland annunciation</strong>. Left, white = armed, right, green = active.
APPR1 means CAT-I autoland, APPR2 means CAT-II autoland.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Basic Autopilot Usage</h3>

<p>Under normal conditions, you will only use the following procedures:</p>

<ul>
<li>Before takeoff: confirm that the autopilot is in TO mode (push the TOGA
button, "Q" key on the keyboard, if not). Select your initial climb altitude
using the ALT SEL knob. If flying an FMS route, push NAV to arm LNAV mode;
otherwise, set the heading bug to the runway heading, and push HDG to arm HDG
mode. Select an appropriate airspeed target for the departure using the SPD
SEL knob (typically between 180-220 kts).</li>
<li>Line up on the runway, set 40% thrust, wait for the engines to stabilize,
then set takeoff thrust. At VR, pull up, retract gear on positive climb,
retract flaps as appropriate, enable AP and AT. Once sufficient altitude is
achieved, the autopilot will switch the lateral mode to LNAV or HDG, and the
vertical mode to FLCH, and the autothrottle will switch from TO to SPDe. The
aircraft now climbs to the selected altitude at climb thrust.</li>
<li>In flight, the procedure for climbing or descending to a different altitude
is: 1. select target altitude 2. push FLCH. This will select appropriate
modes for both the AT and the AP, and the aircraft will level off
automatically.</li>
<li>To speed up or slow down, simply turn the SPD SEL knob.</li>
<li>When passing FL290, the aircraft will automatically switch between KIAS and
Mach speed target selection.</li>
<li>To deviate from the flight plan and just fly a heading, push the HDG SEL knob
to synchronize the heading bug with the current heading, then push the HDG
button to switch to HDG mode, and then rotate the HDG SEL knob to turn to the
desired heading. Pushing NAV will revert back to LNAV mode, and the aircraft
will immediately turn to navigate to the current waypoint.</li>
<li>When approaching your destination, make sure you have the correct ILS
frequency selected on NAV1; fly on a suitable intercept heading (either using
the FMS flightplan, or manually in HDG mode) and altitude, then push APP to
arm LOC and GS mode. If all goes well, the LOC and GS modes will
automatically engage when the localizer and glideslope are intercepted.</li>
<li>Once established on the glideslope, extend landing gear, set flaps as
appropriate, and reduce speed with the SPD SEL knob. The APPR1 annunciations
should appear on the top of the PFD, first the white one, then the green.
Disengage AP and AT around 1000 ft AGL, and manually land the aircraft.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Autopilot disconnection</h3>

<p>The autopilot will disconnect under the following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pushing the AP disconn button on the yoke or the Z key (normal disconnect)</li>
<li>Pushing the AP button on the glareshield panel while the autopilot is active
(normal disconnect)</li>
<li>Small inputs on the yoke or rudder for more than 5 seconds (non-normal
disconnect)</li>
<li>Large inputs on the yoke or rudder (non-normal disconnect)</li>
<li>Various failures (non-normal disconnect, not implemented)</li>
</ul>

<p>When the autopilot disconnects, the AP annunciation on the PFD will flash red,
and there will be an aural alert "AUTOPILOT, AUTOPILOT", until you push the
yoke button or the AP button on the glareshield panel again.</p>

<h3>TCS (Touch Control Steering)</h3>

<p>The autopilot can be temporarily bypassed without disconnecting it entirely,
using the TCS button (W key in most views, including all cockpit views).</p>

<p>While the TCS button is depressed, the rudder and yoke controls will
temporarily control the aircraft; when the TCS button is released, the
autopilot resumes its previously selected modes.</p>

<p>If the lateral mode was ROLL before using TCS, then releasing TCS will
re-synchronize aircraft roll attitude with the autopilot; otherwise, it will
resume the previously commanded heading or NAV course.</p>

<p>If the vertical mode was FPA, then releasing TCS will sync the FPA target to
the current FPA. If the vertical mode was VS, then releasing TCS will sync the
VS target to the current vertical speed. In all other modes, the target will
remain unaffected.</p>

<h3>Advanced Autopilot Usage: VNAV</h3>

<p>In VNAV mode, the autopilot automatically attempts to follow a vertical profile
derived from the active flight plan and configured cruise altitude. However, it
will never climb or descend beyond the selected target altitude, and if at any
point it levels off at the target altitude, it will hold that altitude even
when the target altitude is changed, until one of two things happens:</p>

<ul>
<li>A waypoint is reached that triggers the VNAV logic to initiate another
altitude change (typically, this is a waypoint with an altitude restriction)</li>
<li>The pilot pushes the FLCH button to manually force the autopilot into VFLCH
mode. The autopilot will then climb or descend in FLCH mode until
intercepting the profile, and then switch to VFPA or VALT mode.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is highly recommended to disable VNAV when trying to intercept the ILS,
because any VNAV-induced autopilot mode changes will disengage / disarm APP
mode.</p>

<h3>Advanced Autopilot Usage: FMS Managed Speed</h3>

<p>In FMS Managed Speed mode, the FMS will automatically select speed targets
appropriate for the current flight phase, and according to speed restrictions
on the flight plan. In order for this to work, the following things should be
configured correctly:</p>

<ul>
<li>An active flight plan (via Route Manager, or the RTE and FPL pages in the
MCDU)</li>
<li>Performance settings for all flight phases (via the E-Jet family >
Performance Config menu, or via the PERF INIT and PERFORMANCE > TAKEOFF and
PERFORMANCE > LANDING pages in the MCDU)</li>
</ul>

<p>Managed speed will use the following logic:</p>

<ul>
<li>During takeoff, target V2 until reaching V2, then target V2 + 10 until
reaching the final segment altitude, then target VFS (final segment speed),
then departure speed; when vertical AP mode switches to FLCH, target climb
speed.</li>
<li>During climbs, target climb speed (default: 280 kts), but respect low
altitude limit (default: 250 kts below 10,000 ft / FL100), and interpolate
speed between limit and limit + 2000 ft to produce a gradual speed-up that
does not arrest the climb entirely. At FL290, switch to climb Mach (default:
Mach .73).</li>
<li>Once levelled off after reaching cruise altitude, speed up to configured
cruise speed (default: 300 kts below FL290, Mach .77 above FL290).</li>
<li>When descending, select descent speed (default: 290 kts / Mach .77), but
respect low-altitude limit (default: 250 kts below 10,000 ft / FL100), using
the same interpolation as for the climb.</li>
<li>For the approach (within 15 nmi from the destination), reduce speed to
initial approach speed.</li>
<li>When flaps are set during the approach phase, reduce speed for the next flap
setting, down to final approach speed (Vref + 5 or Vref + 10).</li>
<li>Speed restrictions in the flight plan overrule the above when they are lower
(e.g., a speed restriction of 220 KIAS on the departure will prevent the
aircraft from speeding up to 250 KIAS for the climb).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Autoland</h3>

<p>All flavors of E-Jet in this package are equipped with CAT-II autoland.</p>

<p>The aircraft has two precision approach modes: APPR1 (CAT-I ILS approach,
manual landing), and APPR2 (CAT-II ILS approach, autoland). The BARO/RA knob on
the active side selects the desired approach type: "BARO" for CAT-I, "RA" for
CAT-II. Autoland is only possible when APPR2 has successfully engaged.</p>

<p>Conditions for <em>arming APPR1</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Arrival runway configured as part of the current MCDU flightplan
(NAV -> ARRIVAL)</li>
<li>Correct ILS frequency set on the selected NAV src on the active side</li>
<li>APP mode armed or engaged</li>
</ul>

<p>Conditions for <em>arming APPR2</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>BARO/RA set to "RA" on both PFD's (Captain and FO)</li>
<li>Same minimums altitude set on both PFD's</li>
<li>Arrival runway configured as part of the current MCDU flightplan</li>
<li>Correct ILS frequency set on both NAV radios</li>
<li>Captain's NAV SRC set to NAV1</li>
<li>FO's NAV SRC set to NAV2</li>
<li>APP mode armed or engaged</li>
</ul>

<p>The armed approach mode is annunciated on the PFD in white. If the BARO/RA knob
on the active side is set to "BARO", only APPR1 will arm, requiring a manual
landing. If the BARO/RA knob on the active side is set to "RA", but one or more
of the other conditions are not met, an amber "APPR1 ONLY" annunciation
displays, indicating that despite RA being selected, only APPR1 can be engaged.</p>

<p>Below 1500 ft, the armed approach mode engages, producing a green annunciation.
APPR2, however, can only be engaged if <strong>flaps 5</strong> is set. If all the
conditions for APPR2 are met except flaps, the APPR2 mode will remain armed
until flaps 5 is set, or the aircraft descends below 800 ft AGL.</p>

<p>At 800 ft AGL, the best possible approach mode locks in and cannot be upgraded
anymore. If at this point APPR2 was armed, but flaps 5 isn't set, the approach
downgrades to APPR1.</p>

<p>Procedure for a CAT-II approach and autoland:</p>

<p>DURING DESCENT:
- ARRIVAL RUNWAY - CONFIGURED IN MCDU FPL

<h2>Flight Controls</h2>

<h3>Throttles</h3>

<p>The E-Jet family is equipped with a FADEC system and TRS (Thrust Rating
System).</p>

<p>The normal operative range of the throttle levers is between 0 and 95%
of their travel range; the top 5% command "takeoff reserve" thrust when in
TOGA mode, or "max continuous" thrust in normal flight, overriding the normal
thrust limits.</p>

<h3>TRS (Thrust Rating System)</h3>

<p>Thrust limits are governed by the TRS, and can be configured via the MCDU, in
the "PERF" -> "TAKEOFF" screen.</p>

<p>For the takeoff, three TRS modes are available, labelled TO-1, TO-2 and TO-3;
TO-1 delivers full normal takeoff performance, TO-2 and TO-3 provide downrated
engine thrust for lighter takeoffs, longer runways, and/or cool and low
conditions. In addition, there are three "FLEX-TO" modes, which automatically
provide the same absolute thrust as the non-FLEX takeoff mode would in standard
conditions, up to actual TO-1 thrust (that is, if the FLEX mode would require
a higher thrust setting than normal TO-1, TO-1 thrust will be provided
instead). <strong>NOTE</strong> FLEX takeoff is not yet implemented in the FG E-Jets.</p>

<p>Go-around mode (GA) always uses the same thrust limit as TO-1.</p>

<p>For the climb, two modes are available: CLB-1 (full climb thrust) and CLB-2
(downrated climb thrust). The appropriate one is selected automatically based
on TO mode selection.</p>

<p>In cruise, the engine is downrated to CRZ after 90 seconds of level
unaccelerated flight; it automatically switches back to CLB-1 or CLB-2 when
significant accelerations or climbs are commanded.</p>

<p>Advancing the throttle levers to more than 95% of their travel range engages
"TOGA RES" (TO/GA Reserve) mode when close to the ground, or "MAX CON" when in
the air, overriding the above ratings and driving the engines to max N1. Hence,
it is advisable to stop the throttle levers just short of firewalling them in
order to set takeoff / go-around thrust.</p>

<p>Note that the autoflight system will never command TOGA RES or MAX CON thrust;
hence, to extract maximum climb performance from the aircraft, it is necessary
to disengage the autothrottle.</p>

<h3>Thrust Reversers</h3>

<p>Thrust reversers may only be deployed (DEL key) after touchdown, and with the
thrust lever in the IDLE position.</p>

<p>For a normal landing, deploy reversers immidately after main landing gear
touchdown, gently forward thrust lever to full reverse; retard at 60 kts,
cancel reversers at 40 kts.</p>

<p>For a rejected takeoff, full reverse thrust may be used until the aircraft has
come to a full stop.</p>

<h3>Flaps</h3>

<p>The flap lever controls flaps, slats, and ground spoilers. Settings 1 through 4
are for takeoff and approach, and extend flaps and slats. Settings 5 and FULL
(6) are for landing, and additionally arm ground spoilers. Settings 4 and 5 are
identical, except that flaps 5 arms ground spoilers while flaps 4 does not
(because flaps 4 is for takeoff / approach, but flaps 5 is for landing).</p>

<h3>Speedbrake</h3>

<p>The speedbrake lever controls spoiler deployment to increase drag and reduce
lift in flight, typically to achieve a rapid descent. The speedbrake lever in
this simulation has 5 positions (up, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, full), which you can cycle
with the Ctrl-B key (and backwards with Ctrl-Shift-B). For a detailed
description of spoiler functionality see below, under Fly-By-Wire.</p>

<h3>Autobrakes</h3>

<p>The autobrake knob is used to configure automatic braking for landing and
rejected takeoff. It has the following positions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>RTO</strong>, used for rejected takeoff. In this position, the autobrake system
will apply maximum brakes when there is weight-on-wheels, and the thrust
levers are retarded to the idle position or the thrust reversers are
deployed. Brakes remain applied until the pilots input brakes (switching to
manual braking), or wheel rotations speed reaches zero, or the autobrake knob
is rotated to the "OFF" position.</li>
<li><strong>OFF</strong>: no autobrake whatsoever.</li>
<li><strong>LOW</strong>: at touchdown, apply brakes to achieve a constant deceleration of
0.175g until manual brake input, wheel speed &lt; 60 kts, or autobrake knob
turned into OFF position</li>
<li><strong>MED</strong>: at touchdown, apply brakes to achieve a constant deceleration of
0.3g until manual brake input, wheel speed &lt; 60 kts, or autobrake knob turned
into OFF position</li>
<li><strong>HI</strong>: at touchdown, apply maximum brakes until manual brake input, wheel
speed &lt; 60 kts, or autobrake knob turned into OFF position</li>
</ul>

<p>In the LOW and MED modes, deploying reversers will reduce brake wear and
heating, but will not change the required landing distance or deceleration
rate.</p>

<h3>Nosewheel Steering</h3>

<p>The E-Jet features a complex nose wheel steering simulation faithful to the
real aircraft's steer-by-wire system.</p>

<p>When full realism is enabled (see below), the system works as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>When the pushback is connected, the nosewheel steering system is disabled,
and the pushback truck steers the aircraft.</li>
<li><strong>Free Castering Mode:</strong> The nosewheel steering system will disengage in case
of a failure (not simulated yet), or when the pilot pushes the NWS DISCONNECT
button on the yoke. A "STEER OFF" advisory will appear on the EICAS. When the
NWS system is disconnected, the nosewheel will caster freely; the aircraft
can be steered using differential braking and differential thrust.</li>
<li><strong>Tiller Steering Mode:</strong> Pushing the tiller handle down will engage the NWS
system. While the handle is held down, the tiller controls the NWS system.</li>
<li><strong>Rudder Steering Mode:</strong> When the tiller handle is released, the rudder
pedals control the NWS system.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whenever the NWS is engaged, regardless of which input commands it, the maximum
nose wheel deflection is limited by wheel rotation speed.</p>

<p>The wheel speed dependent nose wheel deflection limits are:</p>

<ul>
<li>+/- 76° up to 10 knots</li>
<li>+/- 20° between 26.2 knots and 89 knots</li>
<li>+/- 7° above 100 knots</li>
</ul>

<p>Between these zones, the limit scales proportionally to wheel speed, providing
a smooth transition between zones.</p>

<p>The tiller handle does not command nose wheel deflection linearly; its range is
divided into 3 linear zones, according to the following schedule:</p>

<ul>
<li>0° handle deflection (normalized: 0.0, dead center) -> 0° nosewheel deflection</li>
<li>20° handle deflection (normalized: 0.25, 1/4) -> 5° nosewheel deflection</li>
<li>50° handle deflection (normalized: 0.625, 5/8) -> 25° nosewheel deflection</li>
<li>80° handle deflection (normalized: 1.0, full input) -> 76° nosewheel deflection</li>
</ul>

<p>This allows for finer control around the center, while the response to stronger
deflections is much more drastic.</p>

<p>Rudder pedals, however, always, command a fixed +/-7° range.</p>

<h4>Nosewheel Steering Realism Options</h4>

<p>Two configuration options (in the Configuration dialog) control the realism of
the simulation:</p>

<ul>
<li>"Separate tiller steering": if set, tiller and rudder operate independently,
as described above; if not set, the tiller axis is controlled by the
rudder axis, up to the speed-dependent limit.</li>
<li>"Realistic nosewheel steering": if disabled, the NWS system is always
engaged, and both tiller and rudder pedals can control the NWS system at the
same time. Inputs from tiller and rudder pedals are summed.</li>
</ul>

<p>For full realism, the following properties should have joystick inputs mapped
to them:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>/controls/gear/tiller-pushed</code> (button): corresponds to pushing the tiller
down to activate it.</li>
<li><code>/controls/gear/tiller-cmd-norm</code> (axis): tiller steering command</li>
<li><code>/controls/gear/nose-wheel-steering-disconnect</code> (button): corresponds to the
"NWS DISCONNECT" button on the yoke.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will most likely also want to have rudder pedals with toe brakes
configured, otherwise you will have trouble steering the aircraft on the ground
when NWS is disengaged.</p>

<h4>Recommended NWS settings:</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>No rudder pedals:</strong> Separate tiller steering: OFF; Realistic nosewheel
steering: OFF.</li>
<li><strong>Rudder pedals, no tiller:</strong> Separate tiller steering: OFF; Realistic
nosewheel steering: OFF</li>
<li><strong>Rudder pedals, tiller, no spare buttons and/or no toe brakes:</strong> Separate
tiller steering: ON; Realistic nosewheel steering: OFF</li>
<li><strong>Rudder pedals with toe brakes, tiller, 2 spare buttons:</strong> Separate tiller
steering: ON; Realistic nosewheel steering: ON</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fly-By-Wire</h3>

<p>The E-Jet has an open-loop FBW system controlling the elevator, rudder, and
spoilers.</p>

<p>The system provides the following functionality:</p>

<h4>Elevator</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Elevator Thrust Compensation (ETC)</strong>: the FBW automatically changes
elevator deflection to compensate for the pitch-up moment resulting from
higher power settings. This feature is disabled when close to the ground, so
as to not interfere with takoff rotation and landing flare.</li>
<li><strong>Tail Strike Avoidance (TSA)</strong>: close to the ground, the FBW limits maximum
pitch to avoid tailstrikes. As the pitch attitude approaches the limit,
elevator authority is reduced.</li>
<li><strong>Mach Compensation</strong>: At high Mach numbers, elevator authority is reduced to
compensate for the increased effectiveness of control surfaces.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Rudder</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Yaw Damper</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4>Spoilers</h4>

<p>The spoiler system consists of 10 spoiler panels, in 4 groups. On each wing,
there is an outboard group of 3 multi-function spoiler panels, and an inboard
group of 2 ground spoilers.</p>

<p>The multi-function spoilers are used for the following purposes:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Speedbrake</strong>, according to speedbrake lever. Speedbrakes automatically retract
when flaps 2 or higher is selected.</li>
<li><strong>Ground spoilers.</strong> When flaps 5 of FULL is selected, and the speedbrake
lever is in the "UP" position, the spoilers will extend fully upon
weight-on-wheels, and retract when either TOGA is activated, or airspeed
drops below 60 knots. Ground spoilers also deploy when a rejected takeoff is
detected.</li>
<li><strong>Roll control.</strong> Multi-function spoilers deploy asymmetrically to support
aileron input (the ailerons themselves are actuated mechanically, and do not
offer FBW features).</li>
<li><strong>Steep approach configuration.</strong> (This feature is available as an option in
the real aircraft; the FG model has it on all types in the family). The STEEP
APPROACH button on the center pedestal activates steep approach mode; when
this mode is selected, and flaps 2 or higher are selected, the spoilers will
deploy 50%, +/- elevator input. This allows the aircraft to descend on a
steep glide path while keeping the engines running at about 55% N1, and
increases vertical controllability. The steep approach mode automatically
disarms when weight-on-wheels is detected, or when TOGA is activated.
Retracting flaps to UP or flaps 1 disables steep approach, but keeps it
armed. Steep approach cannot be armed or engaged on the ground.</li>
</ul>

<p>The inboard ground spoilers only deploy as ground spoilers, together with the
outboard panels, and follow the same logic.</p>

<h4>FBW Laws</h4>

<p>Each FBW channel has 2 laws: "Normal Law", in which all of the above
functionality is available, and "Direct Law", in which control surfaces mirror
raw control inputs, except spoilers, which simply will not deploy at all.</p>

<p>Direct Law is activated whenever there is a failure that may indicate a
malfunction that makes Normal Law unusable or unsafe; it is also possible to
manually select Direct Law using the three guarded pushbuttons on the center
pedestal, above the engine controls.</p>

<p>The currently selected law for the rudder and elevator channels can also be
monitored on the MFD's "Flight Controls" page.</p>

<h2>Navigation Systems</h2>

<h3>IRS (Inertial Reference System)</h3>

<p>The E-Jet is equipped with an Inertial Reference System, consisting of two
Inertial Reference Units (IRUs). These provide position, speed, and attitude
information to various instruments and systems. Before they can be used, they
must be aligned; this process starts automatically when the following
conditions are met:</p>

<ul>
<li>The IRU's are powered (power can be supplied to IRU 1 by the GPU, either
battery, the APU generator, or either of the IDG's; IRU 2 will not power up
on battery though, as only IRU 1 is hooked up to a DC ESS bus).</li>
<li>A reference position has been loaded in the MCDU POS INIT page.</li>
</ul>

<p>The alignment process can take up to 17 minutes, depending on latitude; the
aircraft must remain stationary during this process. If the aircraft is moved,
the FMS will detect this, and restart the alignment process. Loading a
different alignment reference position will also restart the alignment process.
Alignment and reference position are lost when the aircraft is power-cycled, so
the entire alignment process must be repeated after a shutdown.</p>

<p>The alignment process can be monitored via the IRU 1 and IRU 2 sub-pages of the
MCDU POS SENSORS page.</p>

<p>The EICAS will also display a number of cautionary and advisory messages
reflecting the state of the IRS.</p>

<h4>The POS INIT page</h4>

<p>The POS INIT page is accessible via the NAV INDEX menu on the MCDU, or from the
NAV INIT and POS SENSORS pages. It usually shows a selection of 3 position
references:</p>

<ul>
<li>"LAST": the last recorded position of the aircraft. This position is
persisted between FlightGear sessions, but if you respawn in a different
position, or after the aircraft has been towed while not powered or with the
IRU's not aligned, the "last position" will be wrong.</li>
<li>"REF WPT": a pilot-selectable reference point. This can either be an airport,
or an airport plus parking position (notated as ICAO.PARKING, e.g. EHAM.D22
is gate D22 at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport). The FMS automatically fills in
the nearest airport and parking based on GPS coordinates upon starting up;
you can override this by entering an airport and parking in the same format
and inserting it into LSK L2.</li>
<li>"GPS": align the IRUs on the GPS system. (Since FlightGear's GPS simulation
does not simulate GPS errors, this will always be completely accurate).</li>
</ul>

<h4>IRS Configuration Options</h4>

<p>The configuration dialog offers 3 options for configuring the IRS:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>IRU alignment speed</strong>: "normal" = realistic, up to 17 minutes; "fast" = 60x
faster than IRL, up to 17 seconds; "instant" = ~1 second.</li>
<li><strong>Auto-align IRU</strong>: if selected, the IRU will not wait for a valid POS INIT,
but instead automatically start aligning perfectly upon startup. Combined
with the "instant" option, this will give you a working IRS within 1 second
after powering the aircraft up.</li>
<li><strong>Align now</strong>: pressing this button will bypass the alignment logic and
immediately align both IRUs on the currently selected reference, or on GPS if
no reference has been selected.</li>
</ul>

<h2>SimBrief Import Feature</h2>

<p>The SimBrief import feature has been removed, as the SimBrief import add-on
provides the exact same functionality. You can download it from</p>

<p>https://github.com/tdammers/fg-simbrief-addon</p>

<h2>MCDU Route Entry</h2>

<p>The FMS supports entering airway routes, just like the real aircraft. However,
because the way airway data is exposed to aircraft models from FG core is
insufficient for this, the E-Jet relies on finding and parsing the airway data
file itself. To make this work, you need to have a file named
<code>/NavData/awy/awy.dat</code> in one of your scenery directories (the propery tree has
a list of all the directories to look in under <code>/sim/fg-scenery</code>; you can
configure these through the launcher, or by passing one or more <code>--fg-scenery</code>
arguments to the <code>fgfs</code> binary on startup).</p>

<p>FlightGear ships with a severely outdated <code>awy.dat.gz</code> as part of FGDATA; this
file will not work as-is, but if you want to use it for the E-Jet, you can
simply un-gzip it.</p>

<p>To check which nav data has been loaded, consult the FMS "NAV IDENT" page. It
should show an indication of the loaded dataset, as well as the date range of
validity, based on the self-reported AIRAC cycle in the loaded file, if any. If
no file has been loaded, this will be reported as "19SEP 16OCT/13", and
"FG-MINIMAL", indicating that only basic navigation data is available (no
airways). If you have an awy.dat from Navigraph, it will be reported as
"NAVIGRAPH", with dates corresponding to the reported AIRAC cycle; awy.dat
files from XPlane will also work, and report as "AWYXP700" or similar.</p>

<h2>Electronic Flight Bag (EFB)</h2>

<p>The EFB is a virtual tablet that can be used to view charts in PDF format. See
the <a href="./EFB.markdown">EFB documentation</a> for details on how to get content into
the EFB.</p>

<p>General operation:</p>

<ul>
<li>The screen is clickable, simulating a <strong>touchscreen</strong></li>
<li>LMB clicking on the case flips between portrait and landscape <strong>orientation</strong></li>
<li>Mouse wheel on the case adjusts <strong>brightness</strong></li>
<li>MMB clicking on the case operates the <strong>power</strong> button</li>
</ul>

<h2>CPDLC / ACARS</h2>

<p>The E-Jet Family supports in-sim <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACARS">ACARS</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controller%E2%80%93pilot_data_link_communications">CPDLC (Controller-Pilot Data Link
Communications)</a>,
controlled via the MCDU.</p>

<p>ACARS uses <a href="http://www.hoppie.nl/acars/">Hoppie's ACARS</a>, an HTTP-based
ACARS/CPDLC environment used for VATSIM and other networks. To use the Hoppie
backend, you will need to install and configure the <a href="https://github.com/tdammers/fg-hoppie-acars">Hoppie ACARS
addon</a>. The addon is automatically
detected and used if it is loaded properly.</p>

<p>Some ACARS services can also be configured to use other (non-Hoppie) backends.
To configure ACARS backends, go to the "DLK" MCDU page, and select "ACARS CFG"
(LSK L5). At the moment, these configurable services are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>WEATHER</strong> (METAR, TAF, SHORTTAF). Available options are HOPPIE (uses the
Hoppie ACARS system's VATSIM weather feature), NOAA (fetches weather
information over HTTP, from noaa.gov's free service, the same as what FG
itself uses), AUTO (uses HOPPIE when available, NOAA otherwise), and OFF
(turn off the weather backend).</li>
<li><strong>ATIS</strong>. Available options are HOPPIE (uses Hoppie ACARS to fetch VATSIM
ATIS; this only works for stations that have an active ATIS on VATSIM at the
time of sending the request), DATIS (uses the FAA's d-atis service; this will
provide real-world ATIS, but only for supported airports in the US), AUTO
(uses HOPPIE if available, DATIS otherwise), and OFF (turn off the ATIS
backend).</li>
<li><strong>PROGRESS</strong>. This setting controls whether the aircraft will generate OOOI
(Off, Out, On, In) events, and if so, how it sends those. Currently, the only
supported backend is HOPPIE, but you may not want to send OOOI events when
not flying online, even if the Hoppie plugin is running, so you can turn it
off here. The progress configuration line also allows you to select a
receiving station other than the airline code from your flight ID (default is
"AUTO", which uses the first 3 characters from your own callsign).</li>
</ul>

<p>The "FREEFORM" (TELEX) and "PREDEP CLX" features always use HOPPIE if
available, and will not function otherwise.</p>

<p>For CPDLC, three transport backends are supported:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>"NONE"</strong>, a dummy backend that never becomes available. This backend can be
used to effectively disable the entire CPDLC system.</li>
<li><strong>"FGMP"</strong>: this backend connects to IRC via FG's built-in CPDLC API, on FG
versions that support it. It becomes available whenever you are connected to
the FG Multiplayer environment.
<em>Side note:</em> FG's built-in CPDLC API does not implement MIN/MRN, and because
of this, matching replies to requests is a best guess, based on message types
and sequencing. If you use the FGMP backend, it is recommended that you do
not issue a new request until all previous dialogs have been closed, as
uplinks referring to older requests may otherwise be incorrectly interpreted
as replies to the newer request.</li>
<li><strong>"HOPPIE"</strong>: This uses the Hoppie ACARS system for CPDLC (see above).
<em>Side note:</em> The Hoppie system does not transmit ICAO 4444 standard message
codes, instead, it transmits formatted messages in plaintext, using '@' signs
to mark variables. As a result, the CPDLC system will only understand
messages correctly if they are spelled exactly as specified in ICAO doc 4444,
and if variables are marked with '@'. Any deviation from this will cause the
CPDLC system to downgrade such messages to "FREE TEXT"; you will still be
able to read them and issue standard and free text replies, but variables
will not be detected, and message-specific reply options will not be given.</li>
</ul>

<p>To select a CPDLC backend, on the MCDU, go to the NAV page, then select "ATC"
(LSK R1), go to page 2, and select "DATALINK CFG" (LSK L1).</p>

<p>Note that selecting a backend other than HOPPIE for CPDLC will still keep the
ACARS system on the Hoppie network; if you are flying on FGMP and wish to
communicate via the FGMP IRC, then you will have to use CPDLC for that; ACARS
will not work.</p>

<h3>ACARS Usage</h3>

<p>ACARS functionality can be accessed through the DLK menu. Options include:</p>

<ul>
<li>RECV MESSAGES: a log of received TELEX messages.</li>
<li>SENT MESSAGES: a log of TELEX messages you sent.</li>
<li>FREEFORM: send a free-form TELEX message.</li>
<li>WEATHER: request METAR (not implemented yet)</li>
<li>ATIS: request ATIS</li>
<li>PREDEP CLX: compose and send a PDC request over ACARS (this is the default
method on VATSIM; the response will be given via CPDLC).</li>
<li>OCEANIC CLX: compose and send an oceanic clearance request over ACARS (not
implemented yet).</li>
</ul>

<h3>CPDLC Usage</h3>

<p>First, select the backend you want to use. On the MCDU, press the <code>NAV</code> button,
then select <code>ATC</code> (LSK 1R), and then, on page 2, <code>DATALINK CFG</code> (LSK 1L).
Select the backend you want to use, and return to page 1 of the <code>ATC INDEX</code>
page.</p>

<p>On the <code>LOGON/STATUS</code> page, the <code>DATALINK STATUS</code> line tells you whether the
transport is working; if it says "READY", then you are connected to the
selected transport. In the middle of the screen, between "FLT ID" and "ACT
CTR", you can see which backend is currently in use.</p>

<p>You can use the <code>LOGON TO</code> field to enter a station you want to log on to, and
then push <code>SEND</code> (LSK R1) to request a logon. The remaining logon process, as
well as handovers, and automatic.</p>

<p>While you are connected (status: "OPEN"), pushing LSK R1 again will trigger a
CPDLC logoff.</p>

<p><em>NOTE:</em> Some VATSIM controllers use CPDLC clients that do not send the CURRENT
ATC UNIT message, which will leave the CPDLC status hanging in the "ACCEPTED"
mode. If/when this happens, you can push LSK R1 again to force the status to
"OPEN" and start making requests.</p>

<p>The <code>LOG</code> page lists recent messages, both uplinks (from ATC to you) and
downlinks (from you to ATC). This should be largely self-explanatory. Use the
LSK's on the right to open a message, read it, and possibly respond to it.</p>

<p>The remaining items on the <code>ATC INDEX</code> page allow you to compose downlinks from
predefined standard templates to initiate a new dialog.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>Some aspects of the E-Jet can be configured; most of the configuration options
exist in order to find a balance between realism and the practicalities of a
desktop flight simulator, while some others are mostly about performance.</p>

<p>Configurable aspects include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Keyboard mode.</strong> By default, the E-Jet overrides some keybindings that are
normally used for flight controls: the number keys are used to switch views,
or, when one of the MCDU's has grabbed the keyboard, MCDU scratchpad entry.
In keyboard mode, these bindings are disabled, and the aircraft can be flown
with the keyboard.</li>
<li><strong>Separate tiller steering.</strong> When enabled (more realistic), the tiller is
controlled separately through the tiller dialog or a tiller axis input, and
closely matches the behavior of the real aircraft, while the rudder pedals
command up to +/- 7° nosewheel steering. When disabled, the rudder pedals
command a variable, groundspeed dependent, amount of nosewheel deflection
between 7° and 76°; this is less realistic, but makes the aircraft flyable on
setups that do not offer a separate tiller axis.</li>
<li><strong>PFD Coupling.</strong> Normally, the PFD's on both sides have independent
altimeters and minimums settings, controlled from the respective side of the
glareshield panel. However, since most sim pilots fly the aircraft
single-pilot, these checkboxes allow you to link one side to the other. When
coupling is active, one side is the "master" side, and the controls on that
side control altimeters and minimums on both sides. This is particularly
important when using autoland, because APPR 2 will only arm when both sides'
minimums agree.</li>
<li><strong>EFB.</strong> Enables or disables the Electronic Flight Bag (EFB).</li>
<li><strong>EFIS.</strong> This section allows you to turn off some of the EFIS screens, which
can improve performance. It also provides options to tweak the terrain
rendering on the MFD's, both resolution and update speed.</li>
</ul>
